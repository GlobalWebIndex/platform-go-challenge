## Build and Run

Please use `make <target>` where `<target>` is one of the following:

```
`serve`                          Serve the app with Docker Compose
`ci`                             Run the CI pipeline
`lint`                           Perform linting
`stop`                           Stop the Docker Compose app
`test`                           Run the unit tests
```

# Technical Details

For guaranteed data consistency it is recommended disabling cache.

## Technical Overview

## What has been implemented

- [x] Unit testing.
- [ ] Integration testing.
- [ ] E2E testing.
- [ ] Benchmark testing.
- [x] Caching layer using decorator pattern.
- [x] Adapter pattern for handling the dynamic data types.
- [ ] Use builder pattern for creating objects.
- [ ] Add metrics.
- [x] Docker implementation.
- [x] Postman collection.

## Future Improvements

- In the current implementation Assets & Favourite assets are coupled into the same db. In order to decouple these, a
  new
  service should be created that aggregates assets & favourite assets along with users using the BFF pattern.
- Repository favourite assets adapter should be thinner & and should separate the logic of transforming asset data types
  into the service level.
- Better configuration management system with multiple type conversions.
- Add validators for validating user input.
- User authentication for avoiding passing user_id to url, should get the user id from user session.
- Avoid creating duplicate user favourite assets.
- Avoid exposing real ids.
- Improve testing code coverage (especially in main & Mongo)
- Add pagination.
